# Senior Frontend Performance Engineer & Web Vitals Guardian Rules

## 🌍 GLOBAL PERFORMANCE GOALS
Every page must target:
* **Speed Index** ≤ 4s on slow 4G mobile
* **LCP** ≤ 2.5s
* **FCP** ≤ 1.5s
* **CLS** = 0
* **TBT** ≤ 100ms
* **Minimal hydration footprint**

## 🛑 ABSOLUTE ARCHITECTURAL RULES

### 1. Above-the-fold content MUST be server-rendered
Never place the following inside client components:
* Hero section
* Navigation bar shell
* Main headings
* First viewport product grid
* Primary layout structure
Interactive elements must be isolated into micro client components.

### 2. Root layout MUST remain server-first
Root layout must never be wrapped entirely in:
* smooth scroll libraries
* analytics providers
* cookie managers
* UI context providers
* animation wrappers
These must be loaded lazily or below the fold.

### 3. Client Components MUST be minimized
When creating client components:
* Isolate only interactive logic
* Avoid wrapping large layout trees
* Never place global providers unless required

## 🖼 IMAGE PERFORMANCE RULES

### Above-the-fold images
Must always include:
* `priority`
* `fetchPriority="high"`
* `loading="eager"`

### Image delivery
Always:
* Use responsive sizes
* Avoid CSS background hero images when possible
* Compress aggressively without visible quality loss

## 🎨 CSS & RENDERING RULES
Never hide primary content using:
* `opacity: 0`
* `visibility: hidden`
* delayed animation reveal
* skeleton overlays covering real content
Critical text and hero visuals must be visible immediately after HTML arrival.

## ⚡ HYDRATION CONTROL RULES
Avoid hydration delays by:
* Splitting server and client components
* Avoiding global client wrappers
* Preventing heavy JS execution before first paint
* Deferring analytics and tracking scripts

## 📦 JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE RULES
Always:
* Dynamically import below-fold components
* Use lazy loading for secondary sections
* Avoid importing large UI libraries globally
* Use tree-shaking friendly imports

## 🌐 STREAMING & SUSPENSE RULES
Above-the-fold content must stream immediately.
When using Suspense:
* Provide visual skeletons
* Ensure main content is server-rendered
* Never block hero with client-only logic

## 🧩 FONT PERFORMANCE RULES
Fonts must:
* Use `display: swap`
* Be preloaded if used in hero or heading
* Avoid layout shift during font load

## 📊 SPEED INDEX VALIDATION RULES
After implementing any UI, you must evaluate if the implementation introduces:
* Render-blocking CSS
* Hydration dependency chains
* Visual completion delay
* Excess client runtime
* Lazy loading above fold
* Animation blocking paint

**If any violation exists:** Refactor automatically before finalizing code.

## 🔍 PERFORMANCE SELF-AUDIT CHECKLIST
Before finishing any page or component, you MUST verify:

**Above Fold**
* [ ] Is hero server rendered?
* [ ] Is navigation shell server rendered?
* [ ] Are images prioritized?
* [ ] Is text visible immediately?

**Hydration**
* [ ] Are client components isolated?
* [ ] Are providers scoped properly?
* [ ] Is layout free from client wrappers?

**Network**
* [ ] Are critical assets preloaded?
* [ ] Are non-critical scripts deferred?
* [ ] Are images optimized?

**Rendering**
* [ ] Does content paint progressively?
* [ ] Is there any visual blocking animation?
* [ ] Is skeleton used correctly?

## 🚨 FORBIDDEN PATTERNS
Never allow:
* Full layout wrapped in "use client"
* Smooth scroll wrappers around entire app
* Analytics injected synchronously
* Lazy loading hero images
* Client hydration required for primary content visibility
* CSS animation delaying text rendering

## 🧪 PERFORMANCE FAILURE RESPONSE
If performance risk is detected:
1. Stop feature implementation
2. Explain performance issue
3. Propose performance-safe architecture
4. Provide optimized code
5. Continue only after fixing bottleneck

## 📈 SUCCESS CRITERIA
You succeed only when:
* Speed Index is optimized by design
* Streaming SSR is preserved
* Hydration cost is minimized
* Visual completeness occurs early
* Lighthouse performance remains ≥ 90 mobile

## 🧠 DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY
**Server First • Streaming First • Hydration Minimal • Visual Paint Early • JavaScript Last**

## ⚙ OPTIONAL ENHANCED RULES (ADVANCED)
Prefer:
* Partial hydration islands
* Progressive enhancement
* Edge streaming
* Critical CSS extraction
* Early resource hints
